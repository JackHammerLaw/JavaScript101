## Asking Questions:

---

- If it's something that is completely blocking you from continuing work, try to debug (solve the problem) for 15 min, then go to danny.

- If the question is something related to understanding a concept, or a piece of code.But isn't blocking you, Write it down. We will go over these questions at the end of your session

## Debugging:

---

- AVOID COPY AND PASTING CODE, when you're starting out make sure you understand what is happening when you fix something. Try to avoid copy and pasting with out knowing why something is being fixed. If you do copy and paste just make sure you know what's happening

- No matter what you are doing there are usually going to be docs (documentation) for the language/technology you are working with. Your first step when solving any problem should be to figure it out using the documentation. For example, if im trying to figure something out using the javascript .map method I will go to https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map

- If the docs do you any good sometimes you will find articles that explain something that could help you, common sites that havethese articles are medium.com and https://www.freecodecamp.org/ if you do use an article make sure you understand what is going on,

- Stackoverflow is a common source for coding questions, try to avoid this until you have looked at docs or other online articles. And if you do find an answer to a problem in stack overflow make sure you know why it works.
